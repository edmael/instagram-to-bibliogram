# Instagram to Bibliogram
A very basic userscript to redirect all Instagram links to a [Bibliogram](https://sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram/) instance.

The code uses the latest unblocked Bibliogram instance I found (and I try to keep the script updated so that it never run on a blocked one) but you can change it to your own instance or the one you prefer just by editing line 14 an 17 of the script.

There are many improvements that can be done to this code and you're very welcome to do that with a pull request!

## How to use
In order to use this script you should have a userscript manager installed in your browser.

I use [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), but there should be no issues with any of the major userscript manager out there.
